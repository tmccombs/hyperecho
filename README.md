# hyperecho
A very simple HTTP echo server

This is just a simple program that listen on port 3000 and responds to all HTTP
requests by responding with the body of the request and printing the full
request to standard out.

I built this to make it easier to examine the actual HTTP requests being made by
libraries (or tools).
